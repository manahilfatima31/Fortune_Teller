You are usually filled with inherent contradiction.
The best and the worst seem to make you your chosen battlefield.
From spiritual and intellectual revelations, you want the edge on everybody else.
You are usually extremely pore-minded, virtuous, and religious.
You have great magnetic power, and as speakers appeal to the emotions and sentiments of your public more than to logic, but you sway your audiences as you choose.
In dangerous situations and in sudden crises you remain cool and very determined.
You drive yourself hard, and usually drive others unmercifully.
You despise weakness in yourself or in others.
Your worst fault is that you are too adaptable to the people with whom you come in contact.
You readily develop unusual clairvoyant powers.
