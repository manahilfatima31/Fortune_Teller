You are widely known for your dual personalities and ability to change mood from moment to moment.
Although you hate to be tied down, you make lively, entertaining and romantic partners, even if you can be rather fickle if bored or unhappy.
The twin sides of your nature are perpetually pulling in opposite directions.
Your brains are subtle and brilliant but you usually lack continuity of purpose.
Of all people you are the most difficult to understand, in temperament you are hot and cold almost at the same moment.
Once you are attracted to people, you have to ensure that you are not dull or mundane.
You will no doubt spend ages chatting to anyone about every subject under the sun, just to keep feeding your ever active and inquisitive mind.
If taken as you are, in your own moods, you are the most delightful people imaginable.
